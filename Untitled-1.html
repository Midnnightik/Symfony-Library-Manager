    <p><strong>Payment Data.</strong> We may collect data necessary to process your payment if you choose to make purchases, such as your payment instrument number, and the security code associated with your payment instrument. All payment data is handled and stored by NCR Connected Payments. You may find their privacy notice link(s) here: <a href="https://www.ncrvoyix.com/company/privacy-policy?srsltid=AfmBOoqi4_mvlVg5UDQuK7fEK4QgC3Mk6VC75yVNfxZVus3NCRWqRObf" target="_blank">https://www.ncrvoyix.com/company/privacy-policy</a>.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Application Data.</strong> If you use our application(s), we also may collect the following information if you choose to provide us with access or permission:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Geolocation Information.</em> We may request access or permission to track location-based information from your mobile device, either continuously or while you are using our mobile application(s), to provide certain location-based services. If you wish to change our access or permissions, you may do so in your device's settings.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>This information is primarily needed to maintain the security and operation of our application(s), for troubleshooting, and for our internal analytics and reporting purposes.</p>
    
    <p>All personal information that you provide to us must be true, complete, and accurate, and you must notify us of any changes to such personal information.</p>
    
    <h3>Information automatically collected</h3>
    <p><em><strong>In Short:</strong> Some information — such as your Internet Protocol (IP) address and/or browser and device characteristics — is collected automatically when you visit our Services.</em></p>
    
    <p>We automatically collect certain information when you visit, use, or navigate the Services. This information does not reveal your specific identity (like your name or contact information) but may include device and usage information, such as your IP address, browser and device characteristics, operating system, language preferences, referring URLs, device name, country, location, information about how and when you use our Services, and other technical information. This information is primarily needed to maintain the security and operation of our Services, and for our internal analytics and reporting purposes.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><em>Log and Usage Data.</em> Log and usage data is service-related, diagnostic, usage, and performance information our servers automatically collect when you access or use our Services and which we record in log files. Depending on how you interact with us, this log data may include your IP address, device information, browser type, and settings and information about your activity in the Services (such as the date/time stamps associated with your usage, pages and files viewed, searches, and other actions you take such as which features you use), device event information (such as system activity, error reports (sometimes called "crash dumps"), and hardware settings).</li>
      <li><em>Location Data.</em> We collect location data such as information about your device's location, which can be either precise or imprecise. How much information we collect depends on the type and settings of the device you use to access the Services. For example, we may use GPS and other technologies to collect geolocation data that tells us your current location (based on your IP address). You can opt out of allowing us to collect this information either by refusing access to the information or by disabling your Location setting on your device. However, if you choose to opt out, you may not be able to use certain aspects of the Services.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Google API</h3>
    <p>Our use of information received from Google APIs will adhere to <a href="https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy" target="_blank">Google API Services User Data Policy</a>, including the <a href="https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy#limited-use" target="_blank">Limited Use requirements</a>.</p>

    <p><em><strong>In Short:</strong> We process your information to provide, improve, and administer our Services, communicate with you, for security and fraud prevention, and to comply with law. We may also process your information for other purposes with your consent.</em></p>
    
    <p><strong>We process your personal information for a variety of reasons, depending on how you interact with our Services, including:</strong></p>

  <div class="section body_text" id="whoshare">
    <h2>3. WHEN AND WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h2>
    <p><em><strong>In Short:</strong> We may share information in specific situations described in this section and/or with the following categories of third parties.</em></p>
    
    <p><strong>Vendors, Consultants, and Other Third-Party Service Providers.</strong> We may share your data with third-party vendors, service providers, contractors, or agents ("<strong>third parties</strong>") who perform services for us or on our behalf and require access to such information to do that work.</p>
    
    <p>The categories of third parties we may share personal information with are as follows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Data Analytics Services</li>
      <li>Order Fulfillment Service Providers</li>
      <li>Sales & Marketing Tools</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>We also may need to share your personal information in the following situations:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Business Transfers.</strong> We may share or transfer your information in connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business to another company.</li>
      <li><strong>When we use Google Maps Platform APIs.</strong> We may share your information with certain Google Maps Platform APIs (e.g., Google Maps API, Places API). Google Maps uses GPS, Wi-Fi, and cell towers to estimate your location. GPS is accurate to about 20 meters, while Wi-Fi and cell towers help improve accuracy when GPS signals are weak, like indoors. This data helps Google Maps provide directions, but it is not always perfectly precise.</li>
      <li><strong>Affiliates.</strong> We may share your information with our affiliates, in which case we will require those affiliates to honor this Privacy Notice. Affiliates include our parent company and any subsidiaries, joint venture partners, or other companies that we control or that are under common control with us.</li>
      <li><strong>Offer Wall.</strong> Our application(s) may display a third-party hosted "offer wall." Such an offer wall allows third-party advertisers to offer virtual currency, gifts, or other items to users in return for the acceptance and completion of an advertisement offer. Such an offer wall may appear in our application(s) and be displayed to you based on certain data, such as your geographic area or demographic information. When you click on an offer wall, you will be brought to an external website belonging to other persons and will leave our application(s). A unique identifier, such as your user ID, will be shared with the offer wall provider in order to prevent fraud and properly credit your account with the relevant reward.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section body_text" id="cookies">
    <h2>4. DO WE USE COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES?</h2>
    <p><em><strong>In Short:</strong> We may use cookies and other tracking technologies to collect and store your information.</em></p>
    
    <p>We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons and pixels) to gather information when you interact with our Services. Some online tracking technologies help us maintain the security of our Services and your account, prevent crashes, fix bugs, save your preferences, and assist with basic site functions.</p>
    
    <p>We also permit third parties and service providers to use online tracking technologies on our Services for analytics and advertising, including to help manage and display advertisements, to tailor advertisements to your interests, or to send abandoned shopping cart reminders (depending on your communication preferences). The third parties and service providers use their technology to provide advertising about products and services tailored to your interests which may appear either on our Services or on other websites.</p>
    
    <p>To the extent these online tracking technologies are deemed to be a "sale"/"sharing" (which includes targeted advertising, as defined under the applicable laws) under applicable US state laws, you can opt out of these online tracking technologies by submitting a request as described below under section "<a href="#uslaws">DO UNITED STATES RESIDENTS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?</a>"</p>
    
    <p>Specific information about how we use such technologies and how you can refuse certain cookies is set out in our Cookie Notice.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section body_text" id="inforetain">
    <h2>5. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>
    <p><em><strong>In Short:</strong> We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Notice unless otherwise required by law.</em></p>
    
    <p>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer than the period of time in which users have an account with us.</p>
    
    <p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section body_text" id="infosafe">
    <h2>6. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h2>
    <p><em><strong>In Short:</strong> We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures.</em></p>
    
    <p>We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section body_text" id="infominors">
    <h2>7. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?</h2>
    <p><em><strong>In Short:</strong> We do not knowingly collect data from or market to children under 18 years of age.</em></p>
    
    <p>We do not knowingly collect, solicit data from, or market to children under 18 years of age, nor do we knowingly sell such personal information. By using the Services, you represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor dependent's use of the Services. If we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we may have collected from children under age 18, please contact us at <a href="mailto:info@undeuxtroiscafe.com">info@undeuxtroiscafe.com</a>.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section body_text" id="privacyrights">
    <h2>8. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h2>
    <p><em><strong>In Short:</strong> You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time, depending on your country, province, or state of residence.</em></p>
    
    <h3>Withdrawing your consent:</h3>
    <p>If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, which may be express and/or implied consent depending on the applicable law, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section "<a href="#contact">HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?</a>" below.</p>
    
    <p>However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal nor, when applicable law allows, will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.</p>
    
    <h3>Opting out of marketing and promotional communications:</h3>
    <p>You can unsubscribe from our marketing and promotional communications at any time by replying "STOP" or "UNSUBSCRIBE" to the SMS messages that we send, or by contacting us using the details provided in the section "<a href="#contact">HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?</a>" below. You will then be removed from the marketing lists. However, we may still communicate with you — for example, to send you service-related messages that are necessary for the administration and use of your account, to respond to service requests, or for other non-marketing purposes.</p>
    
    <p>No mobile information will be shared with third parties or affiliates for marketing or promotional purposes. Information sharing to subcontractors in support services, such as customer service, is permitted. All other use case categories exclude text messaging originator opt-in data and consent; this information will not be shared with third parties.</p>
    
    <h3>Account Information</h3>
    <p>If you would at any time like to review or change the information in your account or terminate your account, you can:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Log in to your account settings and update your user account.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Upon your request to terminate your account, we will deactivate or delete your account and information from our active databases. However, we may retain some information in our files to prevent fraud, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our legal terms and/or comply with applicable legal requirements.</p>
    
    <h3>Cookies and similar technologies:</h3>
    <p>Most Web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove cookies and to reject cookies. If you choose to remove cookies or reject cookies, this could affect certain features or services of our Services.</p>
    
    <p>If you have questions or comments about your privacy rights, you may email us at <a href="mailto:info@undeuxtroiscafe.com">info@undeuxtroiscafe.com</a>.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section body_text" id="DNT">
    <h2>9. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h2>
    <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Notice.</p>
    
    <p>California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web browser DNT signals. Because there currently is not an industry or legal standard for recognizing or honoring DNT signals, we do not respond to them at this time.</p>
  </div>

    <h2>10. DO UNITED STATES RESIDENTS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h2>
    <p><em><strong>In Short:</strong> If you are a resident of California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, or Virginia, you may have the right to request access to and receive details about the personal information we maintain about you and how we have processed it, correct inaccuracies, get a copy of, or delete your personal information.
